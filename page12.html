<h1>Chapter 12</h1>
<h3>by Annabelle Sawatzki</h3>
<p>
    Bob wanted to try to do lots of different things in his life so he decded to write a bucket list because that was the hip thing to do these days. Among other things he wanted to go white water rafting with his friend Mark, climb a volcano, and go bungee jumping.

    Bob also really wanted to sleep in an igloo in the arctic circle, and fist fight a bear (and win of course). The last thing that Bob really wanted to do was to learn how to be a master sword fighter.
