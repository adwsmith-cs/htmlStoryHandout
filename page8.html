<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<h3>By Peyton Ward</h3>
<p>Bob is a hardworking man, he works as a Costumer Service rep for Croudstrike.</p>
<p> On Fri, Jul 19, 2024, He was bombarded with support calls, he was told by many people that all of their Airline systems are endlessly bootlooping.
    When he told his supervisor about it he told Bob that the other rep's have said the same thing.</p>
<p>When he told the callers that this is happening to a bunch of Airports, not just them they said they were waiting for the next business day to have their IT Department work on a fix for this problem.</p>
<p>In the end every Airline that used Croudstrike on their computers were unable to do boarding on planes or any security checks. So they cancled every flight that was going to take place during this time.</p>
<p>The only airline that didn't suffer from this was Southwest, because they used Windows 3.1 which can't be used with Croudstrike's software.</p>
