<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<h3>by Noah Cook (IP is copilots lol)</h3>
<p>
    Bob lived on a small farm with his loyal dog Max, a mischievous cat named Whiskers, and a curious goat called Daisy.
    Every morning, Bob would wake up to Max barking excitedly, ready for their daily walk. 
    Whiskers would sneak around, trying to steal Bobâ€™s breakfast, while Daisy would peek through the window, hoping for a treat. 
    One sunny afternoon, Bob decided to take all his animals on an adventure to the nearby woods.
    Max led the way, Whiskers climbed trees, and Daisy munched on wildflowers. 
    By sunset, they returned home tired but happy, grateful for another day of friendship and fun.
