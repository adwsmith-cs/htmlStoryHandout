<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<h3>by Kaitlyn</h3>
<p>
    Now that you’ve heard about Bob’s family, it’s time to learn about his friends. 
    Bob has 2 friends because he doesn’t like people very much. His friend Mark likes to run early in the morning, while his friend Susan likes to sleep. Susan sleeps so much that Bob isn't convinced she's even alive. One time, Mark asked Bob to run with him, but he said no, because Mark is <b>insane</b> and likes to run at four in the morning. Bob also hates running. The only thing Bob runs from is his numerous problems.
