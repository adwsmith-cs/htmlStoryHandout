    Bob possesed a job, and while it wasn't anything he adored with all his heart, he didn't mind it. A job was a job afterall, but his boss had incredibly high standards for Bob's work which was rather irritating.

    "Bob, did you torch all the bodies?" "Bob, did you make sure to purchase more bleach" "Bob, I told you already not to be here on tuesdays, that's when the management staff has the weekly upper ranks performance review and it dipleases our patron to have part timers present for the 5 child sacrifice that summons him to grace us with his presense so Bob, please scram. No you will not be getting overtime pay"

        Honestly she was so annoying and cagey, though Bob was getting paid so he sure as heck wasn't going to judge, but no overtime pay, really? After the half hour he took out of his day to be there on a tuesday? As unfair as that seemed, admittedly he did forget he wasn't supposed to be here on tuesday, that was on him.
