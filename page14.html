<h1>Chapter 14</h1>
<h3>by Jaxon Hutson</h3>
<p>Bob has many things in life that he'd like to accomplish for himself. 
    Bob would like to live in a small cabin perched on a freeway in Florida, where he can hear the wonderful noises of cars traveling at 80 miles per hour and smell the wonderful smell of roadkill right on his doorstep, which he may harvest every morning for breakfast.
    Another one of Bob's life goals is to own a Geo Metro; because he lives life in the fast lane, obviously. 
    Lastly Bob wants to find love, real love, but unfortunately he doesn't know how to talk to people, he can only talk to stairs, and fire hydrants, and streetlamps, specifically yellow ones.
