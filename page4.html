Bob jr got excited and chased the squirrel. Bob couldnt hold on and Bob jr ran after the squirrel. Bob was sad. Bob puts missing posters up of Bob jr. Weeks passed and there was no news, but then as Bob was walking outside one day, he sees Bob jr stuffing his mouth with acorns and trying to climb a tree. Bob jr was brainwashed.
