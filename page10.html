<h1>Chapter 10</h1>
<h3>by Quinn</h3>
<p> Bob loves to golf after work. Bob loves golf so much that he plays every day 
    after work. One time after work Bob was playing a round of golf per usual and got to the last hole. It was 
    finally his turn to tee off when all of a sudden his golf club snapped in half! Bob 
    couldnt believe it, in embarrassment he quit the round 
    and then shortly after decided that golf was terrible and that he will never play
    the stupid sport again. He threw his bag of clubs in his fireplace and watched them burn to ashes.
