<h3>by Isaac</h3>
<p> For fun I LOVE to go out of my house!!! It's honistly the best part of my day theres just so much to see and look at.
    The thing I love to do most outside of my house is to go and tuch grass. I never had any in my house so its allwase nice to see. 
    but a fun hobby is swiming i love to swim but I cant do it as oftin as I want because its just to expensive, well what could I do.
