<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h3>by Cohen Ryans</h3>
<p> Bob was born and raised in Oslo, Norway. He hated it it there because when it wasn't cold, it was still cold. so he decided to move to a small island in the middle of the sea called the United States of 'Murica.</p>
<p>When he arrived it had it all! A guy living in a dumpster across the street, Clean enough water (He thinks), and enough food to last him about an hour. The one problem, it was still too cold. then it dawned on Bob.</p>
<p>He was in Canada. It took around three weeks for him to stop screaming with pure agony and disdain. Why was he living in this abysmal dicount France? If he wanted to live in France he would go there. Bob guessed he'd hae to suck it up.</p>
